# Ball's Eye!

***My first prototype unity game that I uploaded to github.***

- This is a simple platform game but the difficulty level will be high.
- I did this project in about 3 hours.
- I have only made 3 levels yet, these levels were made so that the player can know the game and understand the mechanics.

### Options
##### Although most mobile games do not have an options, I thought it would look interesting and added it.
